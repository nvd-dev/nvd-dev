### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub, I started this journey as a backend web developer with a growing interest in Artificial Intelligence and its potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology.

Recently while attending Grad school, I've been exploring the field of machine learning through various projects, and I'm loving every bits of the challenge of learning something new.
